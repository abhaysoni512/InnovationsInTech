/*
Order of execution:
    1. Memory for derived is allocated.
    2. The Derived(double, int) constructor is called, where cost = 1.3, and id = 5.
    3. The compiler looks to see if weâ€™ve asked for a particular Base class constructor. We have! So it calls Base(int) with id = 5.
    4. The base class constructor member initializer list sets m_id to 5.
    5. The base class constructor body executes, which does nothing.
    6. The base class constructor returns.
    7. The derived class constructor member initializer list sets m_cost to 1.3.
    8. The derived class constructor body executes, which does nothing.
    9. The derived class constructor returns.

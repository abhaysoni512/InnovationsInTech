    Captures are treated as const by default
    When a lambda is called, operator() is invoked. By default, this operator() treats captures as const, meaning the lambda is not allowed to modify those captures.
    In the following example, we capture the variable ammo and try to decrement it.

        When the lambda decremented ammo from 10 to 9 to 8, it decremented its own copy, not the original ammo value in main().
        Because captured variables are members of the lambda object, their values are persisted across multiple calls to the lambda!

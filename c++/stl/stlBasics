STL is big tool box which contains many things that will help us in dealing with data

First thing inside STL is container:

Container: containers are the boxes in which we store data that is required for processing.
    most used containers are vector, list, map, queue

Algorithm: Algorithms are like recepies for computers, com use algorithms to tell what we will do with data.
    eg. sorting, searching, grouping, comparing the data, etc

Functors (Function Objects): To write own custmize algorithm we use functors

Iterators are used to navigate through data inside containers

Why STL?

Templates are generic code. they allow us to write a code which can work on every datatypes.

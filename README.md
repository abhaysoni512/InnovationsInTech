# InnovationsInTech

A chapter-wise collection of code and notes for **C, C++, DSA, Competitive Programming, Python**, and small projects.

> Goal: keep all my learning/practice code organized and easy to revise.

## Repository contents (quick navigation)

- **DSA** → recursion, arrays, strings, linked list, stack/queue, BST, STL, etc.  
  📌 See: `DSA/README.md`

- **Competitive Programming (C++)** → STL + recursion practice and more  
  📌 See: `Competetive_programming/README.md`

- **LeetCode practice**
  - `LeetCode/`
  - `LeetCodeLearning/`

- **C++ / Core C++ topics**
  - `c++/`
  - `NetworkingInC++/`

- **Python learning + scripts**
  - `Python/`
  - `PYTHON_1/`
  - Example script: `2_FetchYoutubeVideosPlaylist.py` (exports playlist/video data to CSV like `yt_playlist.csv`)

- **Projects**
  - `Projects/`

- **Security / Shell / DB / Notes**
  - `Security/`
  - `ShellScripting/`
  - `DB/`
  - `Notes/`

## How to run (quick commands)

### C
```bash
gcc file.c -o app
./app
```

### C++
```bash
g++ file.cpp -o app
./app
```

### Python
```bash
python3 script.py
```

## Suggested learning path (optional)
1. Start with `c++/` basics + STL  
2. Move to `DSA/0_Recursion` → `DSA/1_Array` → `DSA/2_String`  
3. Practice in `Competetive_programming/` and `LeetCode/`  
4. Build mini projects in `Projects/`

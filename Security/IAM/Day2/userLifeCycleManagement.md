# What is user lifecycle management?

User lifecycle management (ULM) begins the day a candidate accepts a job offer and continues until that employee leaves the company. For HR and IT departments, this means creating user credentials and connecting new employees to cloud resources. User provisioning is the process of creating and managing user access to applications and resources in the cloud. Smaller organizations might manage these processes manually, but when done at scale, the process can become error-prone and time-consuming. Automated provisioning does in seconds what could typically take an IT staff hours to do manually.

# How does OneLogin support user lifecycle management?

OneLogin's user lifecycle management capabilities include:
- **Automated provisioning and deprovisioning**: OneLogin can automatically create user accounts and assign appropriate access based on predefined rules. When an employee leaves the company, their access can be automatically revoked, ensuring security and compliance.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: OneLogin allows organizations to define roles and permissions, making it easier to manage user access based on job functions. This helps ensure that employees have the right level of access to resources without granting unnecessary permissions.
- **Integration with HR systems**: OneLogin can integrate with HR systems to synchronize user data, ensuring that user accounts are created, updated, and deactivated in real-time based on changes in the HR system. This helps maintain accurate user information and reduces the risk of orphaned accounts.
- **Self-service password reset**: OneLogin provides a self-service password reset feature, allowing users to reset their passwords without needing to contact IT support. This can improve user experience and reduce the workload on IT staff.
- **Audit and compliance reporting**: OneLogin offers robust reporting capabilities that allow organizations to track user access and activity. This can help with compliance requirements and provide insights into potential security risks.

example :

New hires are typically added to a company directory like Active Directory (AD) or LDAP. OneLogin’s real-time user provisioning solution instantly synchronizes with on-prem and cloud directories to provision new user accounts to commonly used apps like Office 365, Google Apps, and Slack. Additionally, companies leverage groups and memberships to assign users to role-specific applications. For instance, a new hire in marketing may require access to Marketo, Salesforce, and Google Analytics. Adding the new hire to the Marketing group will automatically enroll the user in the required marketing apps, so that they’re readily available on day one. By automating provisioning workflows, IT departments gain operational efficiency and save time which frees up IT resources.

The same goes when an employee leaves a company. Remember we mentioned the risks associated with offboarding former employees? When an employee leaves a company, if they aren’t properly offboarded, they may continue to have access to company apps and resources. Automated deprovisioning offers organizations a “kill-switch” that immediately cuts off access to former employees. Once a user is disabled or deleted from an organization’s directory, a kill switch ensures that the user is immediately terminated from all apps and sessions upon their departure.

# Why automate provisioning and deprovisioning?

Automating provisioning and deprovisioning offers several benefits:
- **Improved security**: Automated provisioning and deprovisioning helps ensure that only authorized users have access to company resources. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
- **Increased efficiency**: Automating these processes can save time and reduce the workload on IT staff. This allows IT teams to focus on more strategic initiatives rather than manual account management.
- **Enhanced compliance**: Automated provisioning and deprovisioning can help organizations maintain compliance with industry regulations by ensuring that user access is properly managed and documented.
- **Better user experience**: Automated provisioning can ensure that new employees have access to the resources they need from day one, improving their onboarding experience. Similarly, automated deprovisioning can help ensure that former employees do not have access to company resources after they leave, which can help protect the company's data and reputation.

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data (like bytes) in an ASCII string format using a set of 64 printable characters: uppercase A-Z, lowercase a-z, digits 0-9, and symbols '+' and '/'. Padding with '=' ensures the output length is a multiple of 4 characters. It's not encryption—it's reversible encoding designed for safe transmission of binary data over text-only channels (e.g., email, URLs, or JSON).

How It Works:

Encoding Process:
Take input bytes and group them into sets of 3 bytes (24 bits).
Split the 24 bits into 4 groups of 6 bits each.
Map each 6-bit value to a Base64 character (0-63 corresponds to A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).
If the input isn't a multiple of 3 bytes, pad the last group with zeros and add '=' for each padding byte.

Decoding Process: Reverse the mapping, combining 4 Base64 chars back into 3 bytes, ignoring padding.
Use Cases: Embedding images in HTML/CSS, encoding API keys, or handling binary in text protocols.
Pros/Cons: Increases size by ~33% but ensures compatibility. It's not secure—anyone can decode it.

Example: "Hello, World!" (13 bytes) encodes to "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==" (includes padding).
